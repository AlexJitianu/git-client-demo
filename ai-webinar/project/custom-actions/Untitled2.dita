            <title>Waranties</title>
            <p>A product warranty is a promise made by the manufacturer or seller to repair or
                replace a product if it becomes faulty or fails to meet certain standards within a
                specified period. It serves as a form of consumer protection and provides assurance
                to customers that the product they are purchasing is of good quality and will be
                supported by the company if any issues arise. Product warranties vary in terms of
                coverage, duration, and conditions, and can range from a few months to several
                years.</p>
            <p>Having a product warranty not only benefits the consumer but also enhances the
                reputation and credibility of the company. By offering a warranty, businesses
                demonstrate their confidence in the reliability and durability of their products.
                This can attract more customers and build trust, as buyers feel more secure in their
                purchasing decisions. Moreover, warranties can also encourage customer loyalty, as
                individuals are more likely to choose a brand that stands behind its products and
                provides support after the purchase. Overall, product warranties play a crucial role
                in ensuring customer satisfaction and maintaining a positive brand image in the
                marketplace.</p>
